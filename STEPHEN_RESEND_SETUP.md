2. **Sign up with your email**: stephen.rx782@gmail.com
3. **Verify your email**:

## Step 2: Get Your API Key (2 minutes)

2. **Click "API Keys"** in the left sidebar (or go to https://resend.com/api-keys)
3. **Click "Create API Key"** button
4. **Name it**: `Layer Up Website` (or any name you want)
5. **Click "Create"**
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the API key immediately
   - It starts with `re_` (like `re_abc123xyz...`)
   - You can only see it once, so copy it now!
   - Paste it somewhere safe temporarily

## Step 3: Send the API Key to Sam

**Send Sam your API key via**:
- Text message (most secure)
- Email
- Or tell him in person

**Sam needs**: The full API key that starts with `re_`

## Step 4: Sam Updates Vercel

Sam will:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Update the `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable with YOUR key
3. Redeploy the site
4. Done! Emails will come to you at stephen.rx782@gmail.com

## What You Get with Resend Free Tier:

âœ… **100 emails per day** (more than enough for Layer Up)
âœ… **Free forever**
âœ… **Email notifications** when forms are submitted
âœ… **Dashboard** to see all emails sent

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "Invalid API Key" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you copied the ENTIRE key including `re_` at the start

**Problem**: Not receiving emails
- **Solution**: Check your spam folder in stephen.rx782@gmail.com

**Problem**: Forgot to copy API key
- **Solution**: Delete the old key and create a new one in Resend dashboard

---

## Future: Upgrade Options (Optional)

If you get more than 100 enquiries per day:
- **Resend Pro**: $20/month for 50,000 emails
- But the free tier should be plenty for now!
